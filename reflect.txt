This is the reflection for workshop 3. Off the top of my head, I learned how to define a class type and the significance of privatizing data within that class. This workshop incorporated private and public access within the class to better organize functions that are used in different scopes. Functions that are used within the source file are placed within type private, and functions that are used outside the source file are placed within type public.


However, I encountered some challenges, especially when dealing with the given functions. The parameters of the given functions have inconsistency ordering, which made me a bit confused. Honestly, I still don’t get the point of overloading functions. Why let functions have the exact same name to them? I also named the credit card variables in the class exactly the same as the main variables, which costed me much confusion. Despite these challenges, the workshop solidified my understanding of key object-oriented concepts and increased my confidence in applying them to future workshops or any programming tasks.
